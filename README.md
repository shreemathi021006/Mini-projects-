# Mini-projects

I designed and built a simple obstacle-avoiding car using basic logic gates, showcasing the power of fundamental digital electronics. Instead of using microcontrollers, the car operates purely on combinational logic, utilizing NOT, AND, and OR gates to process input from infrared sensors placed at the front. When an obstacle is detected on one side, the logic circuit processes the signal and redirects power to the opposite motor, enabling the car to steer away automatically. The use of an H-bridge motor driver allows controlled movement of the DC motors based on the gate outputs, making this a cost-effective and educational project for understanding how logical decision-making can be implemented in real-world applications without programming.
